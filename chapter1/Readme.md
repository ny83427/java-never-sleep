## Hello World
```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}
```
[The Hello World Collection](http://helloworldcollection.de/)

---

## Write Once, Run Anywhere?
```cmd
:: Compile source code
javac HelloWorld.java

:: Execute byte code
java HelloWorld
```

---

## Follow Up
* Type `javad HelloWorld.java` and execute, what will happen?
* If you have installed multiple versions of Java, for example, Java 8 and 11, how do you know
which [version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_class_file) you are using to compile the source code?
* Run HelloWorld under Ubuntu without compiling and with compiling

---

## Assignment
* Install JDK8 and `HelloWorld`
* Setup development environment: JDK11/Git/IDEA Community/everything/notepad++/vscode
* Using notepad++/vscode/IDEA to write `HelloWorld` and run it
* Download [Demos and Samples](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and Play

---

## Challenges
* Setup development environment repeatedly is boring, can you [automate](https://gist.github.com/ny83427/4ca8801fb340bb0555e63155a7050ee9) it?
* Install JDK8/IDEA in a different system and `HelloWorld`
* Write a Fibonacci number calclator method inside `HelloWorld.java`

---

## Challenges
* F20 = 6765, how about F100 and how long your method will take to finish?
* Can you resolve Fibonacci number without recursion?
* What will happen for F10000?
